Our project, "Trip Trekker" designs an optimized one-day travel itinerary for tourists. It calculates the most efficient route using the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Dijkstra's Algorithm to minimize travel time. Additionally, it uses a Greedy Algorithm for activity selection to ensure travelers can enjoy their day without time conflicts by efficiently scheduling activities based on their end timesâ€‹.
